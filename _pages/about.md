I am currently a Postdoctoral Research at the University of Pennsylvania working with Prof. [Mayur Naik](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mhnaik/). Our current work focuses on debloating large software systems for increased performance and security. I recently defended my thesis "Language Support for Adaptive Energy-Aware Applications" under the supervision of my advisor Prof. [Yu David Liu]("http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~davidl/") where I received an award for Excellence in Computer Science Research at Binghamton University.

Broadly speaking, I am interested in the intersection between programming languages and real-world systems. My work has focused on using programming languages to help programmers build energy efficient software. We have [published several papers on this intersection between energy systems and programming languages](/publications). Moving forward, I aim to strengthen the support that programming languages and models can provide in energy-critical systems, e.g., UAV programming.
