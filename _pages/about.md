I am a Senior Software Engineer on the Fortify Static Code Analyzer (SCA) team at Micro Focus. I work on developing new language frontends for the SCA static analysis backend, as well as ongoing work on the backend static analysis pipeline. Broadly speaking, I am interested in all things programming languages, from language design, to type systems, to code generation.

I recieved a PhD in Computer Science from Binghamton University in 2019, where I focused on helping programmers build energy efficient software. We have [published several papers on this intersection between energy systems and programming languages](/publications). One highlight of this work is the programming language Ent ([paper](/publication/pldi2017), [github](https://github.com/pl-ent-lang/ent)), which uses a mixed type system to help programmers proactively annotate their software with expected energy consumption, but delay any unknown energy behaviors until runtime. I received Binghamton University's Distinguished Dissertation award for my work.

Currently, I am enjoying learning about compilers for ML models. I have been lucky enough to land my first [commit in the MLIR project](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/3f429e82d3ea1710ee0a841675acba9bb7b658d2). I hope to see how MLIR can be used for static analysis tools.
