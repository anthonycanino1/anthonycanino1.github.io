Broadly speaking, I am interested in the intersection between programming languages and real-world systems. My work has focused on using programming languages to help programmers build energy efficient software. We have [published several papers on this intersection between energy systems and programming languages](/publications). Moving forward, I aim to strengthen the support that programming languages and models can provide in energy-critical systems, e.g., UAV programming.
